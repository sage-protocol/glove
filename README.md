# Glove

Glove runs an LLM agent inside an OS-enforced sandbox and mediates its tool
access. Files and inherited environment variables are denied unless the operator
grants them explicitly.

> Status: research prototype. Remote Sage launch remains disabled until the
> public lifecycle, approval, and resource-enforcement contracts are complete.

## Security model

Glove contains the agent process rather than operating only as a network proxy.

```text
host
├── Glove control, policy, and audit
├── sandbox
│   └── agent
└── approved MCP upstreams
```

On Linux, the sandbox combines user, PID, network, mount, IPC, and UTS
namespaces with `pivot_root`, bind mounts, and seccomp. On macOS, Glove applies
a deny-default Sandbox Profile Language policy before launch. The contained
process receives a minimal environment and only configured filesystem grants.

Glove does not prevent prompt injection, misuse of an allowed tool, compromise
of an unsandboxed upstream tool server, same-user host tampering, or kernel
exploitation. See [the threat model](docs/threat-model.md) for assumptions and
residual risks.

## Build and test

Requirements:

- CMake 3.28 or newer
- Ninja
- Clang 18 or newer
- Linux: libseccomp development headers
- macOS integration tests: `yams`

Run the complete local gate:

```sh
./scripts/preflight.sh
```

For faster development:

```sh
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
```

Linux isolation tests can run in the provided container:

```sh
docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.linux -t glove-linux .
docker run --rm --privileged --security-opt seccomp=unconfined glove-linux
```

## Run modes

`glove run` contains an agent and exposes only allow-listed MCP tools:

```sh
./build/dev/src/glove run \
  --upstream yams=yams,serve,--quiet \
  --allow yams.mcp.echo \
  -- ./build/dev/src/container/glove_synthetic_agent --mode=client
```

`glove exec` contains a direct agent process without attaching the MCP kernel:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/glove-work
./build/dev/src/glove exec \
  --workspace /tmp/glove-work \
  -- /absolute/path/to/agent --version
```

`gloved` is an owner-local control service for plan validation, durable session
state, authenticated receipt delivery, and a Linux managed-session lifecycle.
Live host writes are unsupported. Dynamic path exposure is owner-local;
write-capable sessions use isolated, quota-backed materializations.

```sh
./build/dev/src/gloved \
  --runtime-dir /absolute/owner-only/runtime \
  --audit-key /absolute/owner-only/audit.key \
  --journal /absolute/owner-only/receipts.journal \
  --session-policy /absolute/owner-only/session-policy.json \
  --session-store /absolute/owner-only/sessions.journal \
  --materialization-root /absolute/owner-only/materializations \
  --library-bundle-root /absolute/owner-only/sage-library-bundles \
  --path-exposure-policy /absolute/owner-only/path-exposure-policy.json \
  --path-exposure-journal /absolute/owner-only/path-exposures.journal
```
